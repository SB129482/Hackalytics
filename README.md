### About Stutstut
Over 80 million people worldwide experience stuttering, a difficulty in the flow of speech production. This number is especially prevalent in young adolescent children, where according to the National Institutes of Health, nearly 10% of children will experience some form of stuttering during the ages of 2-6, a crucial period for language acquisition and development. This is especially important as instances of stuttering are known to negatively impact psychological, social, and emotional relations within society.

Our app aims to provide an inclusive, personalized solution towards stuttering in the form of a friendly chat. With the “microphone” feature, users can record an audio input, and have it analyzed with our Sequential Neural Network Model to generate personalized speech practice questions, focusing on improving common stuttering issues including blocks, word repetition, sound repetition, interjection, and prolongation. Overall, this app offers greater accessibility to those who struggle with stuttering via a personalized approach to improving speech clarity and smoothness.
